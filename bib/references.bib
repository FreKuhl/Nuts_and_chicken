@article{Mutyasira.2018,
 abstract = {The adoption of Sustainable Agricultural Practices (SAPs) remains high

on the policy and research agenda in most of sub-Saharan Africa. This

paper adopts an integrative approach to investigate how psycho-social

and socioeconomic factors influence the uptake of SAPs by smallholder

farmers in Ethiopian Highlands. The study applies the Theory of Planned

Behavior theoretical framework, as well as the Ordered Probit model and

Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to model

farmers' adoption decisions. The results show that socioeconomic factors

such as access to agricultural loans and off-farm income, household

labor availability and livestock ownership increase the probability of

adopting two or more SAPs. The results further show that farmers'

intentions and personal norms significantly influence the number of SAPs

adopted at farm-level. These results imply that efforts to promote the

widespread adoption of SAPs by smallholder farmers should focus on

enhancing farmers' access to agricultural loans and off-farm income,

through increased integration into the non-farm rural economy and

addressing liquidity constraints through affordable rural financing

schemes. The adoption of SAPs can further be enhanced by raising

farmers' general awareness and knowledge to change their perceptions and

attitudes towards sustainable farming practices.},

By exploring themes such as dealing with uncertainty and understanding the distinction between a decision and its outcome, the First Edition teaches readers to achieve clarity of action in any situation. The book treats decision making as an evolutionary process from a scientific standpoint. Strategic decision-making analysis is presented as a tool to help students understand, discuss, and settle on important life choices. Through this text, readers will understand the specific thought process that occurs behind approaching any decision to make easier and better life choices for themselves.},
